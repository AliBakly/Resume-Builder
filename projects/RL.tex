\item Implemented a scalable Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm using \textbf{PyTorch}, achieving optimal policy 
convergence for both discrete and continuous control tasks.

\item Engineered \textbf{parallel training} architecture with multiple workers and n-step returns, resulting in \textbf{4x faster 
training} through innovative \textbf{batch processing}.

\item Developed sophisticated reward handling with stochastic rewards and \textbf{reinforcement learning} advantage 
estimation, demonstrating deep understanding of RL foundations.

\item Built comprehensive visualization pipelines using \textbf{Matplotlib} and \textbf{Gymnasium} to track value functions 
and enable data-driven hyperparameter optimization.

\item Achieved 100\% success rate in CartPole while reducing training time from minutes to seconds through effective 
\textbf{parallelization}.
