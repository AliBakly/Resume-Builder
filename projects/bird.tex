    \item Led a machine learning project to classify bird species from audio recordings, \textbf{achieving a 96.31\% accuracy} in identifying three common bird species using advanced AI techniques.
        
    \item \textbf{Automated} data acquisition by \textbf{developing a Python script} that interfaced with the Xeno-canto \textbf{API}, streamlining the retrieval of extensive bird audio datasets.
    
    \item Implemented \textbf{signal processing} and spectral analysis in \textbf{MATLAB} to generate high-quality spectrograms and \textbf{developed an algorithm} for automated syllable detection, enhancing data quality and processing efficiency.
    
    \item Enhanced spectrogram data reliability by \textbf{applying image processing, data augmentation, and feature extraction} techniques in \textbf{Python}, optimizing inputs for convolutional neural network training.
    
    \item Designed and optimized multiple convolutional neural network (\textbf{CNN}) architectures using the \textbf{Keras library} in \textbf{Python} \textbf{refining models} to accurately classify spectrograms and selecting the best-performing model.
